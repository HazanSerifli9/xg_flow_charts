# xG Flow Charts for EFL Matches

This repository contains xG (expected goals) flow charts for three matches played in the EFL last night. xG flow charts are visual representations that show how expected goals accumulate over the course of a match. Each shotâ€™s xG value is plotted on a timeline to give a clear picture of the ebb and flow of attacking opportunities.

What is an xG Flow Chart?

An xG flow chart tracks the timeline of a match, displaying:

Individual Shot xG: The xG value of each shot, plotted at the time it was taken.

Cumulative xG: A running total of xG to visualize how attacking chances build over time for both teams.

These charts provide insights into:

Key moments of attacking dominance.

How evenly matched the teams were in terms of creating quality chances.

Turning points in the match based on attacking output.
